The Jupyter HTML Notebook.

This launches a Tornado based HTML Notebook Server that serves up an
HTML5/Javascript Notebook client.

Subcommands
-----------

Subcommands are launched as `jupyter-notebook cmd [args]`. For information on
using subcommand 'cmd', do: `jupyter-notebook cmd -h`.

list
    List currently running notebook servers.
stop
    Stop currently running notebook server.
password
    Set a password for the notebook server.

Options
-------

Arguments that take values are actually convenience aliases to full
Configurables, whose aliases are listed on the help line. For more information
on full configurables, see '--help-all'.

--debug
    set log level to logging.DEBUG (maximize logging output)
--generate-config
    generate default config file
-y
    Answer yes to any questions instead of prompting.
--no-browser
    Don't open the notebook in a browser after startup.
--pylab
    DISABLED: use %pylab or %matplotlib in the notebook to enable matplotlib.
--no-mathjax
    Disable MathJax
    
    MathJax is the javascript library Jupyter uses to render math/LaTeX. It is
    very large, so you may want to disable it if you have a slow internet
    connection, or for offline use of the notebook.
    
    When disabled, equations etc. will appear as their untransformed TeX source.
--allow-root
    Allow the notebook to be run from root user.
--autoreload
    Autoreload the webapp
    
    Enable reloading of the tornado webapp and all imported Python packages
    when any changes are made to any Python src files in Notebook or
    extensions.
